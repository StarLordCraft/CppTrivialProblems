# CppTrivialProblems

this's some of my cpp codes, notice that i've written it before to begin my academic course, i'll enter in the course in 01/08/2023 and probably this codes wasn't written in better way or following good practices

### OBI Directory

The OBI directory was for a programming competition called "OLIMPIADA BRASILEIRA DE INFORMARICA".

### Why i'm uploading these files now ?

All these files get wrote some mounths ago, but by some reason.... The life isn't easy ..... My TicTacToe Game with WxWidgets Interface just get corrupted and i'm uploading now all my files to prevent this.. And obviously i had to reWrote the TicTacToe game, but ok!

### That's good!

Because all of my focus was in web projects and langueges like JavaScript and recently PHP and just because of this error i'll study c++ again!
And i have the chance to get more deep in the CPP language to create beautiful UI
